Code style of the Columbus project

- functions must be short, anything bigger than one screen must be split
- indentation is 4 spaces, tabs are forbidden
- opening brace always on the same line
- class header files must be minimal
    - no STL #includes because they slow down compilation massively,
      the only exception is string, which is necessary for interoperation
    - forward declarations instead of #includes
