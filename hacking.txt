A quick overview of the internals of Columbus


Data model

The Columbus library has a very simple view of the world.  The basic
unit of data it deals with is the Corpus. A corpus is a collection of
Documents. A document is a named collection of texts and an
ID. Columbus indexes these texts and allows the user to search through
them efficiently.

To make thing more clear, let's examine a simple music database. In it
every song is a document. A corpus with three songs could look like
this:

song0
  Author: Britney Spears
  Name: Toxic
  Album: In the Zone

song1
  Author: Micheal Jackson
  Name: Billie Jean
  Album: Thriller

song2
  Author: The Beatles
  Name: Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds
  Album: Yellow Submarine Soundtrack

Noticed the typo? That's intentional. Very, very few real world data
sources are clean. Errors like this happen all the time, and it is the
job of the search engine to deal with them.
